# Rating Albums

> This page will provide users with information about rating albums, and the differences between rating and ranking. 

Rating albums will look different for everyone. Everyone will have different priorities when rating an album. Sound, lyrics and cohesiveness are all important factors to consider when listening to an album. 

If you are having trouble devising a scale, try listening to a few albums to see what you like then score them. If you are still struggling, review the example below and adjust it to your liking. 

  **10:** A masterpiece, one of the best albums ever created 

  **9:** A personal favorite, will go back to listen often 


  **8:** A Great album with a few minor flaws that hold back from being a favorite


  **7:** Has good tracks, but lacks hard-hitting tracks 

  **6:** Okay album with 2 - 3 good tracks 

  **5:** A neutral album, neither good or bad

  **4:** Boring or uninteresting 

  **2 - 3:** A bad album 

  **1:** So bad it’s almost funny 

### Ranking Vs Rating 
[Rating](glossary.md#glossary) an album is a way of scoring an album that is not contingent on other albums. The score that is assigned to the rating is based on many factors from the album. This will be a score of 1 - 10 and won’t deviate from this scale. The [ranking](glossary.md#glossary) is its place among all of the albums you have listened to. If you have listened to 50 albums in a year, you will have rankings ranging from 1 - 50. The rankings are dependent on the other albums you have listened to.
