# Why use MyFavoriteAlbums to track your listening

> This page will provide potential MyFavoriteAlbum users with an explanation on why to use the application, what it tells you and compare its features with other applications. 

In recent years, music tracking has become all the rage! Learning more about your habits and listening trends has become a great way to share your music with others and expand your taste. However, these applications provide this data when they feel like it. Users must rely on these apps to provide their data, which can lead to issues and risk factors with your data being stored by these companies. MyFavoriteAlbums can be updated as often as you would like. With you tracking your own data, you have the ability to update your site as often as you would like. 

### What MyFavoriteAlbums tells you about your listening
MyFavoriteAlbums, like its name, focuses on your favorite albums over time. No one knows your favorite albums better than you, so our application relies on you to record and upload your listening data. The application displays top albums over a range of years, the ranking information for your [albums](glossary.md#glossary) by each [artist](glossary.md#glossary), top albums by year, number of vinyls owned by year and top vinyls that you donâ€™t own, and compares your rankings of two artists over the years. The application is built using the [programming language R](glossary.md#glossary), and can be customized to display other data visualizations.
